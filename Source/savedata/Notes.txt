Explain my programming background, my interest in LUA and machine learning

Decided to make an archery project

Describe archer and target

Do manual shots

Explain metrics

Turn on AI (a)

Explain it is learning in what is an infinate state

Show the metrics as it explores and learns

Go to 200 arrows

Explain exploit and turn it on (r)

Show how it is more on target. Show the metrics

Explain it is doing mostly exploiting and some exploring

Remind ppl it is still an infinate state

Take a note of the metrics

Go to 450 arrows

Now it has learned, lets see how well (e)

Some go behind the target and some fall short but the vast majority are on target.

Go to 650

Explain how I really wanted to test with a wall (w) (e - learning)

After 1000 arrows - turn off explore (e)


Summary
- started with an infinate state with angle and strength
- random actions was not impressive but it provided some learnings
- deliberate exploitation with a bit of exploration gave great learnings
- forcing an unexpected event (the wall) forced new learnings
